# PERKS
PERKS sample implementation of iterative stencil solver and conjugate gradient solver

Explanation of how to run conjugate gradient solver is in:

./conjugateGradient/README.md

Explanation of how to run stencil solver is in:

./stencil/2dstencil/README.md

./stencil/3dstencil/README.md

You can compile code with config.sh and then build.sh in the ./conjugateGradient, ./stencil/2dstencil and ./stencil/3dstencil folders.
The executable will be in ./build/init folders.
